Countries could refer to cross-cutting challenges affecting the implementation of the Convention and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, or specific obstacles that have hindered progress. These challenges may include lack of adequate financial, human and technical resources, difficulties regarding interministerial/inter-agency cooperation and coordination, lack of timely and reliable access to knowledge, information and data, lack of scientific expertise to support project development and management, and lack of access to relevant technologies for implementation.
